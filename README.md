This is a simplified version of the classical Frogger arcade game, implemented
using html5 canvas and javascript.

This demonstrates the use of:
* pseudoclassical class pattern
  * with hidden private data and methods
* (nested) pseudoclassical subclassing
* over-riding superclass methods
* using superclass methods in subclassed prototype methods
* function callbacks
* smooth animation on html5 canvas
