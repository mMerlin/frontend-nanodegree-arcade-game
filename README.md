This is a simplified version of the classical Frogger arcade game, implemented
using html5 canvas and javascript.

This demonstrates the use of:
* pseudoclassical class pattern
  * with hidden private data and methods
* (nested) pseudoclassical subclassing
  * with get and set properties using function scope methods
* over-riding superclass methods
* using superclass methods in subclassed prototype methods
* function closure scope private 'inner' functions
* singleton pattern
* function callbacks
* communication though custom events
* smooth animation on html5 canvas
* finite state machine
