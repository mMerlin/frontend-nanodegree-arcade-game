/* app.js
 * This file provides the functionality for the active game elements.  That is
 * anything that gets display on (over) the playing field.  This includes the
 * display and any funcational features of each element.  Current elements are
 * player (Frogs) and enemies.  Different enemies have different attributes.
 *
 * Game Events:
 *  Player moves to open (unoccupied) terrain (grass or roadway)
 *  Player moves to terrain already occupied by enemy
 *    Peform 'landedOn' enemy action: in base game, same as smash
 *  Player moves off of playing field
 *  Enemy collides with player sprite
 *    Perform 'smash' enemy action
 * Future Expansion game events:
 *  Player moves to terrain already occupied by enemy
 *    Peform 'landedOn' enemy action (check for teeth location)
 *      Some enemies are 'all' teeth
 *  Player moves to deadly terrain (the river, or far bank)
 *    Have invisible enemy sprite, and treat as 'landedOn'
 *    Set low Z, so will land on mobile enemy first
 *    Currently N/A, since no river to cross
 *  Player moves to terrain occupied by prize
 *  Enemy collides with prize
 *
 * NOTE: logs are not really enemies.  The river is the enemy.  However
 *  crocodiles act the same as logs, plus they can eat a frog.  Simpler to have
 *  the log (and prizes) as enemies, but without a 'kill' method on collision.
 *    Currently N/A, since no river to cross
